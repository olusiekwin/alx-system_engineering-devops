## Background Context

While working for SlideShare, I developed an auto-remediation tool named Skynet, dedicated to monitoring, scaling, and fixing Cloud infrastructure. Skynet utilized MCollective, a parallel job-execution system, enabling the execution of commands on one or multiple servers simultaneously. The tool facilitated the application of actions to selected servers based on filters such as hostname or other metadata (e.g., server type, environment).

Unfortunately, a bug emerged in my code that passed nil to the filter method, leading to two significant issues:

1. MCollective interpreted nil as 'all servers.'
2. The action I sent was to terminate the selected servers.

This resulted in an unintended consequence: 75% of SlideShare's conversion infrastructure servers were shut down, impacting users' ability to convert PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, and videos.

Puppet played a crucial role in the recovery process, allowing us to restore the infrastructure to normal operation within one hour. Imagine the manual effort required to launch servers, configure and link them, import application code, start processes, and fix bugs in such a scenario. Writing Puppet code for infrastructure is an investment, but in the long term, it proves to be a must-have.

1. Ensure you have met all the installation requirements.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Write your Puppet manifests following the specified guidelines.
4. Run `puppet-lint` on your manifests to ensure compliance.
5. Apply your Puppet manifests using the `puppet apply` command.
6. Check the result by inspecting the created file in `/tmp/school`.

**Note:** Adapt the paths and commands as needed for your specific environment.
