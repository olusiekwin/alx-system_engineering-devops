# 0x1A. Application Server

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing your web infrastructure by integrating an application server alongside Nginx, which is already serving static web pages. The objective is to connect the application server to Nginx, enabling it to handle dynamic content for the Airbnb clone project.

## Concepts

- **Web Server:** A server that serves static content to users.
- **Server:** A computing resource that processes requests and provides services to other computers.
- **Web Stack Debugging:** Troubleshooting and fixing issues within a web stack.

## Background Context

Your existing web infrastructure uses Nginx for serving web pages. While Nginx excels at static content delivery, an application server is required to handle dynamic content generation. This project guides you through integrating an application server into your setup, ensuring a comprehensive and efficient web solution.
