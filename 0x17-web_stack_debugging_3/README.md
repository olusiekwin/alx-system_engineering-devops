## Description

This project involves debugging a WordPress website running on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack. The primary goal is to troubleshoot issues that may not be adequately addressed by logs alone. As a developer, it's essential to navigate through the stack when unexpected errors occur.

## Concepts

For this project, we expect you to be familiar with the following concepts:
- Web Server
- Web stack debugging

## Background Context

When debugging, sometimes logs are not sufficient due to unexpected software behavior or insufficient log information. In such cases, it becomes necessary to delve deeper into the stack. Fortunately, this is a skill that Holberton students are well-equipped to handle.
