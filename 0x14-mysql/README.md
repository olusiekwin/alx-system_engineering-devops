## Project Summary
In this project, you will dive into MySQL, covering topics such as database administration, web stack debugging, and the installation of MySQL 5.7. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of the main role of a database, the concept of a database replica, the purpose of a database replica, and the importance of storing database backups in different physical locations. Additionally, you will explore the setup of a primary-replica cluster and develop a robust database backup strategy.
