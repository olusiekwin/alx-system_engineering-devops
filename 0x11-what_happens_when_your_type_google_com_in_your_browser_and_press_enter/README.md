# Project 0x11: Unveiling the Web Stack Magic

## Overview

This project, initiated on Dec 11, 2023, aims to explore the intricate workings of the web stack when a user types "google.com" into their browser and hits Enter. Led by Sylvain Kalache, the project falls under the realms of DevOps, Network, and SysAdmin, carrying a weight of 1. The project must conclude by Dec 18, 2023, at 6:00 AM.

## Background Context

Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer entails comfort with interacting across various layers of the stack. To evaluate this proficiency, engineers are often asked to explain how a software system functions. This project focuses on delving into the infrastructure side, encompassing aspects like network, servers, and security.

## Blog Post

To fulfill the project requirements, you are expected to create a blog post detailing the journey from entering "google.com" to the rendering of the web page. This narrative should cover DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the web stack magic.

## Requirements

### General

- Publish your blog post on the platform of your choice; LinkedIn or Medium are recommended.
- Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.

### Manual QA Review

It is your responsibility to request a manual QA review for your blog post from a peer before the projectâ€™s deadline. In the absence of peer reviews, you should request a review from a TA or staff member.
