# One-Server Web Infrastructure Design

## Introduction
This document outlines the design of a one-server web infrastructure to host the website accessible via www.foobar.com. We will address the requirements and explore the roles of the various components, as well as the potential issues with this setup.

### What is a server?
A server is a computer or software system that provides services to clients over a network. In this context, our server will host the website for www.foobar.com.

### What is the role of the domain name?
A domain name is a human-readable address that maps to an IP address, allowing users to access websites. "foobar.com" is configured to point to our server's IP address, 8.8.8.8.

### What type of DNS record is "www" in www.foobar.com?
The "www" in www.foobar.com is typically a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record that points to the domain's primary record or the server's IP address.

### What is the role of the web server?
The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests, manages static content, and can act as a reverse proxy to route requests to the application server.

### What is the role of the application server?
The application server processes dynamic content, executes code, and interacts with databases to generate and deliver dynamic web content.

### What is the role of the database?
The database (MySQL) stores structured data for the website, including user accounts, content, and other information.

### What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer requesting the website?
The server communicates with users' computers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over the internet.

## Issues with the Infrastructure
1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** This architecture has a single server, making it vulnerable to hardware or software failures. Redundancy, load balancing, and failover mechanisms can mitigate this issue.

2. **Downtime during maintenance:** Maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code, can lead to downtime. Implementing rolling deployments and load balancers can minimize downtime during updates.

3. **Cannot scale with incoming traffic:** This setup may struggle to handle a sudden increase in incoming traffic. To address scalability concerns, consider load balancing, caching mechanisms, and potentially distributing the application across multiple servers.

To enhance the infrastructure's resilience, you can implement strategies to mitigate the SPOF and scalability issues.

In this updated diagram:

"Domain" is explicitly labeled as "foobar.com" and is configured to point to the server's IP address "8.8.8.8," addressing the domain name requirement.
"Nginx" represents the web server, "MySQL DB" represents the database, and "App Server" represents the application server, fulfilling the requirement of these components in the infrastructure.
This diagram more clearly represents the one-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com while addressing the specified requirements.
